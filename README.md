# note-finding-practice
A game to help you practice guitar.

### Two game modes:

1. [**Find Fret**] Find the corresponding fret from given string and note.
2. [**Find Note**] Find the corresponding note from given string and fret.

### How to play it

1. Choose game mode.
2. Type in how many tries you want to take and the time limit for each try.
3. Click 'Done' or hit Enter.
4. See the description on the top (ex: 'E string, fret 3') and figure out what note/fret it is before the timer runs out!

*Make sure you have **Python 3.5+** installed in your computer. This game uses built-in packages so you don't have to install anything else.*
