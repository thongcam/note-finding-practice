# note-finding-practice
A Python game to help you practice guitar

### How to play it 

1. Type in how many tries you want to take and the time limit for each try.
2. Click 'Done' or hit Enter.
3. See the description on the top (ex: 'E string, fret 3') and figure out what note it is before the timer runs out!

*Make sure you have **Python 3.5+** installed in your computer. This game uses built-in packages so you don't have to install anything else.*
